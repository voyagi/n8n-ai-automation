## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- OpenAI over Claude for AI processing (n8n has native OpenAI node)
- Google Sheets over Supabase for storage (more relatable for clients)
- Screen recording over live deployment (sufficient for portfolio demo)
- Spam detection branch included (demonstrates conditional logic)
- Subject field changed from dropdown to text input for flexible free-text entry (01-01)
- Validation CSS scoped to .has-blurred class to prevent page-load error styling (01-01)
- Submit button structured with separate spinner and text spans for JS toggle control (01-01)
- Placeholders set to transparent to prevent overlap with floating labels (01-01 fix)
- fnm used for Node.js version management (n8n requires <=24.x, system had 25.2.1)
- Header Auth over Basic Auth for webhook security (more flexible, easier rotation) (02-01)
- Webhook response mode "When Last Node Finishes" for synchronous AI processing (02-01)
- Field paths use $json.body.* structure with note for testing adjustment if needed (02-01)
- Remove client-side timestamp from payload - n8n Set node adds submittedAt server-side (02-02)
- Use AbortSignal.timeout() for 15-second timeout (native browser API vs manual AbortController) (02-02)
- Change success heading to "Message received!" - more accurate than "sent" (reflects processing) (02-02)
